# mortgage_calculator
This program calculates the schedule of payments given mortgage parameters. It outputs the monthly schedule of payments to an excel file.

As you already know, there are numerous online calculators. I created this to validate and understand the details better. I welcome any contributions to this program. Feel free to fork and add any enhancements, and let me know if a pull request is needed to merge the changes.
